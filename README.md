# jLab-Web3-Fullstack-Practice
+ A tutorial of Full Stack with Web3! Inspired by Guoyu!
+ As we all know, Web2 stepping into Web3 has many barriers.
+ Me too. So I search many materials or lessons or git repos.
+ At last, I get the truth: Do it yourself, then, You will hold it.
+ There is also a famous rule: Feynman Technique, it told us learning, thinking and outputting.

## How to start?
+ I will give a serie
+ s of lessons.
### 1> How to become a Full Stack Engineer?
+ There is only one way: invest your hours into the learning and thinking, then outputting a product.
+ So I will spent about 3 month to these lessons.
### 2> How about the best practice?
+ We have many resource to read and practice, Masters to learn about.
+ I select one begin, Guoyu's article, [here](https://guoyu.mirror.xyz/RD-xkpoxasAU7x5MIJmiCX4gll3Cs0pAd5iM258S1Ek)
+ And I write some articles after reading: [Blogs](https://blog.jlab.tech/web)
### 3> Show me the code, don't talk so much!
+ Yes, I will show you the learning procedure and talk about the note and codes.
+ All the codes will be push to this repo.
+ Free to get and use.

## Part 1
+ Fast reading and circle the points out.
+ Read the article above, read the blog I write.
+ [Blog1](https://blog.jlab.tech/jlab-web3-fullstack-engineer-1)
+ [Blog2](https://blog.jlab.tech/jlab-web3-fullstack-engineer-2)
+ [Blog3](https://blog.jlab.tech/jlab-web3-fullstack-engineer-3)
+ [Blog4](https://blog.jlab.tech/jlab-web3-fullstack-engineer-4)
+ [Blog5](https://blog.jlab.tech/jlab-web3-fullstack-engineer-5)
+ Then tell me your thinking?
+ I will give the next steps with note and video talking.
+ Different people different background, so find your right way and go down.

## Part 2
+ Write down which areas you want to invest your time, it depend on your Web2 old skills.

+ [Solidity5]()
+ [React-hooks]()
+ [MaterialUI]()
+ [Wagmi(Ethers.js)]()
+ [Hardhat-full]
+ [Foundry-full]

## Part 3
+ Build a product that use all stacks, and with real utility!
+ Push it to the Hackathon with special topics.
